                <h2>
                    Do I need any previous knowledge to learn
                    beatboxing?
                </h2>

                <p>
                    No, you don’t need any experience, you can start immediately. The learning concept of
                    seboom assumes <strong>zero knowledge</strong> of beatboxing and progresses from there. Each video
                    builds on the previous videos. We cover breathing and sounds and teach you whole
                    beats and routines. You can learn at your own pace and work your own way through the
                    sections. Step by step you will discover the whole world of beatboxing.

            <li class="Q2">
                <h2>How is the course structured?</h2>

                <p>
                    The course follows a didactic concept. We explain
                    everything beatboxing has to offer in a simple, understandable and step-by-step
                    manner. You are not on your own – in the videos the seboom coaches practice with
                    you. All lessons are designed to build on each other. Each lesson follows on
                    directly from the previous one. No learning content or topics are skipped, but
                    are presented clearly and practiced in detail. In this way we enable a
                    continuous learning curve with a slowly increasing level of difficulty. You will
                    be challenged in every lesson, but not overstrained!
                </p>

                <p>
                    You can beatbox in every lesson. Each video has its
                    own exercises that help you to immediately apply and internalize what you have
                    learned. So every new lesson means a new skill for you!
                </p>

                <p>
                    At regular intervals we will return to what you’ve
                    already learned in a masterclass. In this masterclass we use the beats you’ve
                    already learned to create new sounds and beats. This gives you the opportunity
                    to be creative, develop your own rhythms and expand your musical repertoire. We
                    will also provide special workouts to train your mouth, throat and tongue
                    muscles and perfect your sounds and beats.

                <p>
                    The <strong>beatbox</strong> website course covers breathing
                    technique, spoken rhythm, beats, rhythms, whole covers and routines. We are
                    continuously producing new content.

                <h2>
                    Do I need to be able to read music?
                </h2>

                <p>
                    No, reading music is not a requirement for the online
                    seboom beatbox course. We have developed our own notation which shows you which
                    syllables, words and sounds you need to produce. This makes the exercises
                    intuitive and easy to follow. You <strong>don’t</strong> need any special knowledge, just the
                    ability to read.

                <h2>How can I pay?</h2>

                <p>
                    We accept <strong>PayPal</strong> and the following <strong>credit cards</strong>:
                    Visa, Mastercard, Maestro and American Express.

                <h2>How can I cancel my subscription?</h2>

                <p>You can cancel your subscription at any time by going
                    to <strong>“My profile”</strong> <strong>“My subscription”</strong> and clicking on <strong>“ Cancel
                        subscription ”</strong>. Your
                    subscription will then end at the end of the
                    term. If you have a <strong>monthly</strong> subscription you can <strong>cancel</strong> monthly,
                    if you have a
                    yearly subscription you can cancel annually. You still have access to the
                    tutorial videos until the end of the term. If you cancel your subscription
                    within the free 7-day test trial you are not charged any fees but your access to
                    the tutorial videos ends immediately.
